# KanbanKrazy
   ## Description:
   This project allows a user to login using JWT authentication. The user can then create multiple tickets that are listed as "To do" or "Done." The server verifies if the username and password are valid and generates a secret token that is saved to local storage. This token is deleted when the user logs out.
